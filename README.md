# Convex-Optimization-Final-Project
Multi-objective optimization in Federated Learning

Repository Contains a single PDF file being my final presented work in the course of Convex Optimization, Fall 2023, EE Dept.
In this work I tried to summarize the paper [Federated Learning Meets Multi-objective Optimization]([url](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11489)https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11489) in a matter that focuses on the literature of optimization. As a grain of salt, I also proposed what I learnt from my work in Differential Privacy as a constraint to preserve privacy.
